        // BUT CAN'T add a String number to an int to make them add mathematically

        // Can apply the same logic for doubles;
        double someDouble = 123.45d;

        // Section_3_First_Steps.Strings in Java are immutable (can't be changed after they're created).
        // If we want to modify them (add or delete characters) then a new String must be created.
        // So on ln22, numberStr does NOT get appended the value 10 (stored in someNum).
        // Instead a new String is created which consists of the previous value of numberStr concatted with the String repr of 10.
        // The result is that a new string got created and replaced the old one, which got discarded.

        // Appending strings, resulting in the creation of new strings is generally INEFFICIENT!!!
        // A better alternative is to use StringBuffers, which can be modified (we'll look at this in a later video)

    // Reading Binary Data stream is easier than reading data from a Text file, because we don't have to do any
    // String Parsing to get the integer values. So the DataInputStream class takes care of building primitive
    // types (e.g. int and double) from the bytes in the file.

    // N.B. - Didn't code as the Adventure code from InputOutput was already getting really messy.

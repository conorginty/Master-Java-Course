    // 157. Maps

    // The Maps Interface is part of the Collections framework, even though it's NOT a true collection, in the
    // true sense of the meaning of a Collection (as we've seen previously)
    // The Maps Interface replaced the now obsolete Dictionaries Abstract Class, and like the class it replaced,
    // it maps keys to values. A Java Map can NOT contain duplicate keys, and each key can only map to a
    // single value.
    // We'll focus on 2 Java Classes that implement the Map Interface:
    // 1. HashMap
    // 2. LinkedHashMap
    // And 1 that implements the SortedMap Interface (i.e. 1 level below Map);
    // 1. TreeMap

    // Maps, like all the core Collection interfaces are Generic. They take 2 types;
    // 1. For the Key
    // 2. For the Value

    // N.B. - Maps are unordered data structures
}

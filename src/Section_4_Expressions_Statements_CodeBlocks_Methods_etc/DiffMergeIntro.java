        // DiffMerge = Program that'll help us to visually compare and merge files on any OS.
        // Other tools (e.g. code repositories) use similar merge operations.
        // When following the code-alongs, it's easy to make a typo and get stuck - this is where DiffMerge can help.
        // Every lesson has the code attached to it that the author typed in the videos, and this can be downloaded as zip files.
        // By downloading and unzipping the code, and comparing it with our own, we'll be able to easily find any errors/typos made by using DiffMerge.
        // With DiffMerge, you can compare a single file or a whole folder, and visually see the differences side-by-side (i.e. between yours and the author's code)

        // 52. Install Diffmerge

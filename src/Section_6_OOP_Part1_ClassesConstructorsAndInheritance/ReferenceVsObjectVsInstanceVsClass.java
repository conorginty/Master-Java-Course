    // 83. Reference vs Object vs Instance vs Class

    // We'll use the analogy of building a house to understand these concepts
    // A class = a blueprint for a house. Using the blueprint, we can build as many houses as we like based on that blueprint.
    // Each house you "build" (i.e. instantiate using the 'new' operator) is an object, known as an instance
    // Each house you build has an address (i.e. a physical location) - this is known as a reference
    // You can copy that reference as many times as you would like, but there is only 1 house
    // We can pass addresses (i.e. the location of the instance in memory) as parameters to Constructors and Methods

    // We we instantiate a Class, the variable stores a reference to that object
    // If assign that reference to a new variable, then we have 2 references to the same object!

    // e.g. - Look at House
}
